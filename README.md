### Hi, there! My name is Weronika 👋

---

I work as a **React Developer**. In my free time, I like to play around with tech - backend, mobile, embedded systems etc. My expertise lies in the web development though.

I've studied Computer Science in English at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan and I have an Engineer's degree.

**I love:** Swimming 🌊 Plants 🌱 Cooking 🍲 Creating music 🎶

💬 Ask me about anything you'd like! I'm open to new experiences and collaboration.
