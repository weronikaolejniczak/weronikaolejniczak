### Hi, there! My name is Weronika ðŸ‘‹

I work as a **Web Developer**. In my free time, I like to play around with tech - back-end, mobile, embedded systems etc.

I've studied Computer Science in English at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan and I have an Engineer's degree.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you'd like! I'm open to new experiences and collaboration.
